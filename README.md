# Countries-And-Their-Neighbours
A simple API based webpage which randomly fetches a country and it's neighbor, if it exists, and provides details such as it's population, currency, and language

To fetch data of the countries I've used the free API - REST Countries (https://restcountries.com/).

Minor issues you might face : 
1. Data for some countries is not available, hence cannot be rendered.
2. Countries which are islands do not have any neighbors, hence they'll show an error.

Changes to be done :
1. Render the error message in a card styled format.
